# Dreem_Sleep_Staging
Automated sleep staging using the data from the Dreem Headband by Beacon Biosignals


Overview

Beacon's AI platform for brain data enables and accelerates new treatments that transform the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases. Through FDA-cleared EEG wearables, novel machine learning algorithms, enormous datasets, and advances in software engineering, we are changing the way patients are treated for disorders of the brain.

In this challenge, you will build algorithms to automatically classify sleep stages by using data from the Dreem Headband, a self-applied, at-home EEG headband.

Description
Problem Overview

We propose to use Dreem headband data to perform sleep stage scoring on 30-second epochs of physiological signals.
Context

Sleep plays a vital role in an individualâ€™s health and well-being. Sleep progresses in cycles that involve multiple sleep stages: wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. Different sleep stages are associated with various physiological functions. Monitoring sleep stages is beneficial for diagnosing sleep disorders. The gold standard to monitor sleep stages relies on a polysomnography study conducted in a hospital or a sleep lab. Different physiological signals are recorded, such as electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, etc.

Sleep stage scoring is then performed visually by an expert on epochs of 30 seconds of signal recording. The resulting graph is called a hypnogram. It provides a compact description of the night.
